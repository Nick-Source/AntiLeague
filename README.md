# AntiLeague

AntiLeague brings only the best for its users. This program is designed to Blue Screen your computer when League of Legends is opened, preventing you from playing. This program will singlehandedly save the world.

## Note

AntiLeague was made realtively quickly and is not a perfect project. It was made as a joke. Don't expect this to bypass antivirus as the techniques used are not effective enough.

## Installation

***WARNING:*** Make sure nothing is being written to the disk before running this program!

Run **"AntiLeague.exe"** as administrator, with the XOR encrypted payload DLL alongside. The DLL must be titled with the format **"AntiLeauge - KEY"**, replacing **KEY** with the 10 digit decryption key. Your PC will shut down upon first install. After turning it back on, AntiLeague should be installed.

## Uninstallation

To remove this program simply create a file named **"N6BixkdcE4"** and place it on the desktop. After doing so, restart the PC and you will be prompted with a confirmation message.
